Welcome to my blog, I'm happy you found it. The blog is hosted by github-pages and you can contact me or give me feedback by adding issues to the corresponding repository: [Create new Issue](https://github.com/Phmager/phmager.github.io/issues/new). If you find any bugs or wrong information, and want to correct them, you can use pull requests for the same repository.

Okay now, that we have the technical stuff covered, I want to introduce myself a bit. I'm Philipp and currently studying my masters degree in computer science in Munich, Germany (TUM). I started developing .NET and particularly C# applications when I was 12 years old in 2004. Since then I loved developing applications and always learning new technologies and I still do. I'm intrested and have knowledge in the whole .NET ecosystem: C#, WPF, Silverlight, XAML, WP7, WP8, WinRT, ASP.NET, ASP.NET vNext and WCF.

Currently I'm working for a local software development firm and a tax firm as an independent contractor.
